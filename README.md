# Get Started

The version of python used is 3.10.6.

This repository contains the code from our efforts to formalize a scalable theory of mind in multi-agent systems. We published a theoretical paper on this topic at the Agentic Markets workshop at ICML 2024, titled [Scalable Approaches for a Theory of Many Minds](https://openreview.net/forum?id=P0oG5gDh6T). Although none of the experiments were included in the final version of the paper, we are currently working on a follow-up paper that will feature the experimental results.
